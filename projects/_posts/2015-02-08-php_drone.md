[Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) requires git to be installed within [docker images](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/).

The official PHP images do not come with git -that's what this is about!

**Note** that only a very small subset of all PHP versions are supported - feel free to contribute if you need one that does not yet exist.
