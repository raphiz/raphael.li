This project was a quick-and-dirty experiment to simplify the comparison of two or more [INI files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) on a section and key basis.

I created this project because localization for a project I worked on was based on INI files. This tool helped me to ensure that all sentences were translated.


Here is an example result:
