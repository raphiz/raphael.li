Open\HSR is a society founded by students of HSR to promote Open Source and Free Software.

Together with a couple of [fellow students](https://github.com/orgs/openhsr/people) we currently try to revive the society. Part of this process was re branding (formerly, the society's name was alt.comp.hsr) as well as a complete relaunch of the website.

## Website
The website helps students to work with Linux at HSR since the IT department supports Windows only.
We started on the basis of [my website](http://www.raphael.li) (you might recognise the "Tipps & Tricks" page) and later implemented auto deployment with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org). My part consisted mostly of writing content (documentation on how to set up VPN, printing and so on).

## Open\HSR connect

The vision of Open\HSR connect is to make using the HSR IT infrastructure as comfortable as possible for Linux users.
We plan to implement synchronisation for lecture notes as well as automatic installation of printing and VPM.

[Open\HSR connect](https://github.com/openhsr/connect) is in an early stage and under active development.
