Raphael.li is my personal website and protfolio page. It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The code is open source - feel free to copy my work!

My vision for this website is to publish things I learn and make it available everyone. It should also be a place where my work can be explored.

I don't like the concept of a blog very much because I think it's not user friendly to explore - that's why I created a "resource" page where my posts can be explored by tags instead of an endless stream sorted by date.

Another goal was to allow everyone to contact me securely. I created a secure communication section on the contact page which makes this very easy. It's probably not unbreakably secure but better than no encryption!
