It can be very fascinating, to browse in old books. However, these old books are often not accessible to everyone - which makes sense, since we won't damage them too much.

Thanks to open data, thousands of scanned books are available on platforms such as [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/texts), [e-rara.ch](http://www.e-rara.ch/) and so on. These are usually PDF documents - which is fine for research but not if you
want to exhibit them in a museum.

This bookshelf Projects is a simple and cheap way to exhibit such old books with a simple computer
(running Windows or Linux) and a touch screen.
