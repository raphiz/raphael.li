Redbackup was the study project at [HSR](http://hsr.ch/) of [Fabian](https://github.com/fabianhauser/) and me.

Redbackups vision is to allow users to create encrypted backups and store them in their own distributed cloud. Checkout the [redbackup website](https://www.redbackup.org/) and the [task description](https://www.redbackup.org/problem-statement.pdf) for further reading.
