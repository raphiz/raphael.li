The HSR Studentenportal is a platform for students to share study materials, past exams and more.

Sadly, the project wasn't actively maintained no more. [Fabian](https://github.com/fabianhauser/) and I identified the tedious setup process as one possible obstacle that discourages possible contributors. We, therefore, migrated the project into docker containers so that new contributors can install docker, clone the repository and get started immediately.
