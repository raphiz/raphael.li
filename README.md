Personal website and portfolio, built with Jekyll.


## Build it

Make sure `make` and `docker` are installed.

```bash
make buildimage # Build the docker image
make serve # serve the page (at 0.0.0.0:4000)
```


## To be done:
* Migrate less to sass (+ allow minifier via assets plugin)
* Put more stuff on the index
* Add status & initiation to the project list
