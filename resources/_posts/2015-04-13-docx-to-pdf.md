title: Convert docx to PDF

I used to get lots of mails with Micorsoft Word Documents attached. I just had to read and print them - editing was not required. Libreoffice did quite a good Job displaying `doc` files but it still struggles with the `docx` file format introduced in Office 2007(!!).

Instead of using LibreOffice, I find it more intuitive to convert the files directly into PDFs. This can be done with a free service called [Smallpdf](http://smallpdf.com/).
